# To Do

* Make accordion sidebar for nav-bar; will only expand when on the main page
* Migrate pictures and meta-data for pics to database for storing
* make an easy submit page for updating portfolio; will only be accessible to me with credentials
* make user login for me only
* prettify it (this may be the heaviest time sink? Maybe)
